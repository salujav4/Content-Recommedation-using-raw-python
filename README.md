# Content-Recommedation-using-raw-python

The recommendation system is created with just raw code and concepts of python. It uses basic concepts of string, lists, array, dataframes, sets and dictionaries.
As the code is not clean and has been created with great understading of data, seeing how accurate it is the quality of code can be ignored. There are comments in each cell block for your understanding can be ignored. Thank You. The dataset was provided by SONY^TM in its competition Sony RISE on the hackerearth platform. Thank You
